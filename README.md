 
E-Commerce Website (PHP)
Overview

This project is a full-stack e-commerce web application developed using PHP and MySQL, built on top of an existing open-source frontend template.

Frontend Source Attribution

The frontend design (HTML, CSS, and base JavaScript) is based on:

Original Developer: codewithsadee

Repository: anon-ecommerce-website

The original project provides a static e-commerce UI only.
Full credit for the design and layout belongs to the original developer.

I do not claim ownership of the frontend template.

My Contributions

I independently developed and integrated all backend functionality, including:

PHP backend architecture

MySQL database design and integration

User registration and login system (with password hashing & sessions)

Service order cart functionality (add, update, remove, total calculation)

Order processing and checkout logic

Secure server-side validation

This project transforms the original static template into a fully functional dynamic e-commerce system.
